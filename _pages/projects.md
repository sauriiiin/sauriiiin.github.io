The emergence of new genes has been primarily attributed to the re-organization of existing genetic material by processes like gene duplication, horizontal gene transfer, and gene fusion/fission. The possibility of genes arising de novo from previously non-genic regions has been considered extremely unlikely. Despite this notion, genomes of all sequenced organisms contain genes that share no detectable homology to genes in other species. The proto-gene model of de novo gene birth provides one possible mechanism through which these genes might have arisen. This model formalizes an evolutionary continuum from non-genic sequences to proto-genes to genes. It is hypothesized that proto-genes provide the organism with a transient pool of novel sequences to sample from, of which those that lead to an adaptive advantage are retained by natural selection to become de novo genes.
